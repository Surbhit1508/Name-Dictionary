# Name_Dictionary
This Dictionary is a data structure that efficiently supports various operations like search, insert, delete, and auto search for words. The implementation of this dictionary utilizes the Trie data structure.

Algorithms and Data Structures:

The Trie data structure is used to store and organize the words efficiently.

Complexity:

Each operation, such as search, insert, delete, and auto search, has a time complexity of O(len), where len is the length of the words being processed.

Modifications and Improvements:

Any modifications or improvements to this Name_Dictionary implementation are highly encouraged and welcomed. Feel free to contribute to enhance its functionality and performance.

Thank you for your contribution and support!
